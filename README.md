# PGM_modeling_BilevelOptimization
PGM assistive device modeling and bilevel optimization

In this repository, we provide a simulation framework to calibrate muscle-tendon parameters based on prior recorded data and simulate muscle-tendon dynamics based on the assistive moment using PGM exoskeleton assistance. This framework uses trajectory optimization to simulate muscle dynamics and solve muscle redundancy.

# Simulation framework
Our simulation framework calibrates muscle-tendon parameters and simulates optimal assistive moment and its corresponding muscle-tendon dynamics interaction. Each tool can be used independently. The inputs are a scaled musculoskeletal model computed from OpenSim and additional inverse kinematics and dynamics solutions, depending on the simulation objectives.

We provide a scaled musculoskeletal model and motion data: inverse kinematics, inverse dynamics, of a subject walking at a preferred speed. Digitalized data is also provided. Please take a look at our studies for more details.
